        This project was used as a reminder course. Since only blueprints were used, it was easy to follow up and re-learn the basics. The course link can be found <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ue5-ultimate-bp-course/" target="_blank">here.</a>
        The things that I learnt with this course are following ones : 

        <ul>
            <li>Basic character and object movements</li>
            <li>Level Design</li>
            <li>Basic Game Design</li>
            <li>Event dispatches, Blueprint Interfaces</li>
            <li>Cinematics</li>
            <li>Creating in-game menu</li>
            <li>2D Game Development; Sprites, Textures etc.</li>
        </ul>

        Below, I've added a gameplay videos showcasing the very first version of the my 3D game.

        This game was not being made to be released, just being made together with the lecturer. Most of the meshes were taken from the "Stack-O-Bot" project. Additionaly, the songs that play in the background in the level belongs <br>
